# spatial-data
In the last assignment (2C) it's important to note, that there are two solutions.
One grouped by each color occurence and one grouped by unique combinations of colors. 
Also, there are two plots of each grouping, one bar chart (which makes most sense) and one histogram (which doesn't really make sense)
